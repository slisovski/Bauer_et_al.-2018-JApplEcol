# Supplemental code for: Bauer, S., Lisovski, S., Eikelenboom-Kil, R.J.F.M. Shariati, M. & Nolet, B.A. (2018) Behaviour-based migration model for shooting geese along flyways

This repository contains supplemental code to reproduce the analyses described in the paper entitled "Shooting may aggravate rather than alleviate conflicts between agriculture and migratory geese".

# Content
